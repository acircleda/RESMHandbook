# Introduction

Welcome to the R Handbook for ESM Students. This handbook will be a hands-on guide to help you learn R. It will take you from install, to set up, from data cleaning to analysis.

This guide uses real data to help you practice with R. Specifically, it uses survey data from the [RStudio Learning R Survey](https://github.com/rstudio/learning-r-survey).
