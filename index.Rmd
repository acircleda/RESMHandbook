# Introduction {-}

Welcome to the R Handbook for ESM Students. This handbook is a hands-on guide to help you learn R. It will take you from installation, to set up, from data cleaning to analysis, visualizing, and reporting.

<!-- Might modify this part if we include different data sets -->

This guide uses real data to help you practice with R. Specifically, it uses survey data from the [RStudio Learning R Survey](https://github.com/rstudio/learning-r-survey).

## What is R? {-}

**R** is a free, open-source programming language for statistics and data visualization. It is used in a variety of fields (e.g. science, business, education) and is considiered an in-demand skill to learn ([Muenchen, 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200416222014/https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)). As of June, 2020, R is also among the [top-10 most popular programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

R is useful not only because it is popular, but because it facilitates a reproducible workflow where one can easily reproduce cleaning and analyses operations with minimal effort. Furthermore, because it is open-source, it allows users contribute to and expand its base functions, giving it the power to do things other statistical software packages cannot.

## Key Terms {-}

Below are some key terms you should be familiar with before getting started with R. Links will lead you to more information and examples contained in this handbook.
